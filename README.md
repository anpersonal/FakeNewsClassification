# Fake News Classification

# Goal

The goal of this project was to:

1. Use SpaCy to preprocess the news article text.
2. Use a SpaCy model to classify the preprocessed news article text as fake or real news.
3. Select another model to classify the news article text as fake or reals news.
4. For each model try two configurations of hyperparameters.
5. Evaluate the performance of the models.
6. Compare and contrast the results.

# Code

Two different files are provided:

1. Project2_Spacy_FINAL.ipynb
  
   This file contains the code that accomplishes the above goals for the Spacy Model.
   
4. Project2_BERT_FINAL.ipynb

   This file contains the code that accomplishes the above goals for the BERT Model.

# Notes

A lot of the code for this task comes from various sources including the course notes, and a TensorFlow tutorial on text classification using BERT. I have taken these resources and made them fit my dataset. Thank you for all the publicly available resources.
